            "description":"We’re not going to stretch the truth here. This isn’t singletrack nirvana. It is, however, a great section of trail to connect High Plains to the other Marshall Mesa trails. It is a really wide road with a little climb up to the top and a nice quick descent back down. If you just have to ride something skinny, there is a singletrack on the east side of the road for long stretches. Thanks to your friends here at BMA, that singletrack next to the road is officially legal to ride on. There is, however, one small section just off this trail that will test your skill. About halfway down the hill, look for a trail off to the right. This short connector has some water bars and some rocky steps. Beginners, watch your step! There are quite a few hikers out there, so please be courteous!",

            "description":"High Plains Trail is a great addition to the Marshall Valley trail network. It is a nice long segment of trail with fun flowing singletrack. This trail can be run as an out and back, or as part of the Dirty Bismarck loop. From the Greenbelt Plateau trailhead, the trail starts by gently going down through some short rock sections. Don't worry, these are not very technical. They will just bounce you around a little. After you cross a few gates and a bridge, you start your climbing to the end. The climbing is of a nice grade, not too steep! It includes some brief breaks in the climb as well. As you crest the last hill, you'll see the end at a gate and small parking area. If you want to continue on to Superior, go through the gate and turn right onto Coalton Trail. This area does fairly well over the winter, but can be deceiving. The muddy spots are usually hidden from the road and can be very sticky and fragile. Please make sure you check the trail meter! If you are headed back to the Greenbelt Plateau trailhead, get ready for some nice gentle downhill almost all the way back. In the summer, this trail can get HOT! There is no tree cover at all, so come prepared. Also, it can get really windy out on the trail. Eldorado Canyon causes a nice funnel for the wind to flow over the trail.",

            "description":"The Canyon Loop is a short but stunningly beautiful 20 minute lap. From either parking lot or the Betasso Link Trail, take the Canyon Loop Trail in the required direction. Both directions are fun and the county usually changes the required direction on the 1st of every month. You start at a high point and descend about half way before climbing back up to where you started. The trail is bench cut on a steep slope. So although the trail is technically pretty easy, it can cause problems for those with a tendency for vertigo. Most of the trail is pleasant singletrack, relatively flowy, and about 3 feet wide, but perhaps 1/4 of the loop is on the historic Betasso Ranch road. There's an incredible overlook counterclockwise from the trailhead, less than a mile along the trail that overlooks Boulder Canyon with great views of the the University of Colorado and the city. This trail is closed to bikes on Wednesdays and Saturdays</b> and has a  required direction for bike traffic at all times - please obey these  rules and BMA will continue to work within the political process to make the system work better, especially as the new trails on the Benjamin  Property open, hopefully in early 2011. Betasso Preserve is one of the few places to get in a mountain bike ride from town without the use of a car. To do it, however, you have to ride  up the Boulder Creek Path, which goes through town and up Boulder  Canyon to the intersection with Fourmile Canyon. Then you have to jockey  with traffic on Boulder Canyon Drive (Highway 119) for a short distance  before taking a steep uphill just before the tunnel to get on the  Betasso Link Trail.",

They recently acquired 400 acres to the north and west of Betasso Preserve and decided to build an additional 4 or so miles of trail that connect to the Canyon Loop Trail. The trail will consist of a loop connected to the current Canyon Loop with a stem trail. Another spur trail will go from the new loop to Fourmile Canyon Drive. BMA has done several trail work days with the county on this property and this is going to be a very exciting, flowy, and fun trail. Stay tuned for more information and get ready to thank the county for building even more awesome shared use trails.",

To get to it either ride up the Boulder Creek Path to where it dead ends at Fourmile Canyon and then jump onto Boulder Canyon Drive (Highway 119) or park at the head of the trail just before the tunnel on Boulder Canyon Drive. It's 1 1/4 miles uphill - far too much uphill in some places as you will notice on the first two pitches of babyheads.  This particularly heinous introduction to the Betasso Link Trail is where the trail follows the old water treatment plant pipeline. Sometimes, when the planets are aligned correctly and you've coked up on too many Red Bulls, you just might be able to clean the first 1/4 mile of this trail.</p> <p>As you get further up the trail you'll start going up some switchbacks that wind their way up to Betasso Road next to the water treatment plant. Cross the road and continue along to intersection with the <a href=\"/trails/canyon-loop\">Canyon Loop Trail</a>. While this trail technically could be ridden as a shuttle, we highly recommend against doing so for two reasons: 1) this is a heavily used trail close to town and you're going to cause a stir with your battle-ready downhill gear, and 2) the trail isn't that hard and you look a little foolish trying to play downhiller on a trail this uninspiring. Do yourself and us a favor and buy a lift ticket at Keystone, Winter Park, or Sol Vista... and enjoy the climb!",

It is a steady climb out to a nice overlook from the top of the ridge at the end of the road. It is an out and back, so turn back around and come back down the road you just climbed. There are lots of erosion rollers in the road that can make great kickers - just make sure there aren't any families, children, or dogs in your way before you decide to go airborne. On its own Meyers Homestead is hardly worth the trip, but now, with the recent development of an approximately 1 mile connector trail between Meyers Homestead and the 7.2 mile <a href=\"/trails/walker-ranch-loop\" target=\"_self\">Walker Ranch Loop</a>, you can now add this trail to those to get in an almost 15 mile ride.</p> ",

You can ride it either direction but I normally hit it counterclockwise to get the nice flowing singletrack descent on the backside.  You will need to carry your bike down the stairs to the creek.  Take a look at the map at the trailhead before doing the loop, but the route is well marked.  Save an hour or two for this ride depending on how fast you want to go.   Ride from Boulder and do a Super Walker -- but be sure to bring food, water, and a jacket on this ride since it's pretty long.",

            "description":"Re-root may very well be the coolest trail around Nederland, and shows you just how much untapped opportunity there is for those of you in Boulder County that want to build some really cool stuff. Re-root is a USFS authorized re-route of Root Canal. It incorporates some optional lines that only the sickest riders will do (although I've seen some pictures of really young kids riding those very lines). But it also offers some challenge for intermediate technical riders as well, and there is always an easy ride around any challenging line. Some of the optional lines include a steep rock cobbled slab (intermediate) with a rock drop to a small tranny (expert) right next to it (with a ride around). There's a double constructed out of a glory hole, a 5 foot tall boulder with a dirt ramp built up to use it as the apex of a 90 degree left turn or ride over the top for a steep line down the backside you only get to see at the very last second. Sam's Club is an extra challenging line that still gets ridden so little you have to know where it is to find it. A big thank you to the creative trio of Duncan Wheeler, Troy Mandery, and Dave Kingsbury for applying their vision and their shoveling power to making the really cool trail a reality.The ability to build this trail came from years of positive relations between BMA and the Boulder Ranger District of the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest. Recreation Supervisor Ed Perault was the second BMA Hero in part because of his efforts to make the entire West Magnolia area a legitimate riding area. BMA has chipped in through trail work days, kiosk building, and a focused bike patrol presence for many years now. We owe a debt of thanks to those folks that volunteer and continue to show the Forest Service that working together, the Boulder Ranger District, BMA, and mountain bikers like you can make a difference. Sadly, the pine bark beetle is descending upon the entire West Magnolia area. Some of this land will be logged preventatively. Working with the Forest Service and the Wildlands Restoration Volunteers, BMA hired Countour Design to work with some mountain biking stakeholders to protect this and some of the best other trails in West Mag from logging. Still some trails will be lost, and the Forest Service is ready to work with BMA to rebuild those trails. We certainly hope more people like Duncan, Troy, and Dave step up to rebuild some of the new trails. We might end up with one of the coolest trail riding areas around. Projects like this take motivated volunteers and money to make a reality. If we don't step up to make our riding areas better, we lose them If you are not already a BMA member, sign up now. If you're interested in coming out for a trail work day or to stay on top of developments and opportunities like this one, sign up for the BMA newsletter and we'll keep you in the loop.",

            "description":"<p>You've ridden the rest, now ride the best!</p> <p>If you're in the mood for a mellow trail to hit when you're out of shape and ready for a relaxing afternoon, this is not the trail for you.</p> <p>This first time you ride this trail, it's gonna feel all jumbled and funky like trying to force conversation on a first date in high school. But, after a couple of runs on this, you'll get your groove on and it's a flowing pump track of silliness. Rolling sections, ripping tight turns, rock problems that will make you balance, and a constant grade that is just the right steepness for giggles make this one of the best trails in the Front Range. The trail's just a couple of years old and it's a reflection of what trail designers have learned about making trails fun, safe, and sustainable in the last couple decades.</p> <p>At 5.5 miles one-way, it's not a small ride all by itself, but you can connect this ride with the rest of Heil Valley Ranch (see below) or go totally bonkers and do this as part of the <a href=\"/route/boulder-monster\" title=\"Boulder Monster!\" target=\"_blank\">Boulder Monster</a>! My favorite afternoon ride is to start in town and add an out and back on the <a href=\"/trail/wild-turkey-trail\" title=\"Gobble Gobble - Wild Turkey\" target=\"_blank\">Wild Turkey</a> to get to the overlook!</p> <h2>Riding the Trail</h2> <p>Starting at the Picture Rock trailhead, get your schmancy bike clothes on, be sure to tie your shoelaces and head across Red Gulch Road and hit the trail. Does it seem smooth and flat to you? Just wait, the hurt is coming! After about a half mile the open fields end and you'll start getting into the narrow singletrack goodness.</p><p>You've got two miles of groovy flowing uphill until things really change up again. As you're cruising up here, be aware that there are a heck of a lot of blind turns here so riding with an iPod may be a bit of a death wish. Ever wonder what a \"picture rock\" is? About a mile in, you'll see a big rock picnic table. The tabletop is a special kind of sandstone quarried right here in Lyons called picture rock. After the trail was completed, we at BMA thought that it would be swell to have a place where everyone could chill out and enjoy the view, so we paid for this table to be put in.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://bouldermountainbike.org/sites/default/files/PR_picnicTable.JPG\" width=\"400\" height=\"264\" /></p> <h3>The Great Space Coaster</h3> <p>See that awesome hunk of singletrack in the photo at the top of this page? Sweet isn't it? That's what I call the Great Space Coaster. On the way down, remember this thing. It's a giant red super rideable flowmaster of fun. Just watch out for that last boulder on the right as you the ride out of this section. There are all these scratches on that rock - I hope they're just from pedals and the occasional horse shoe.</p> <h3>1/2 Point (mile 2.5) - The Silo</h3> <p>If you're a beginning rider and getter here freaked you out or you barfed up your lungs, there's no shame in turning around. If you are feeling your inner badness, however, prepare to kick it up a notch! From here up to the top of this trail, Picture Rock gets a lot more technical. It's not the rock garden of madness known as <a href=\"/trail/lower-bitterbrush-trail\" title=\"Lower Bittbrush Buttkick\" target=\"_blank\">Bitterbrush</a>, but it's got some funky bits of rock hopping that regularly claims chainrings. There's nothing here that a strong rider can't clean and it's great fun for the rock riding fetishist, but the <a href=\"/og/bike-patrol\" title=\"Bike Patrol\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Patrol</a> has built up quite a list of injured cyclists they've helped off the mountain here.</p> <h3>Rockin' the Top</h3> <p>Yup, just about the time that you think that this uphill is never going to end, you'll get to mile 5.5 and you'll be at the end of the trail. Picture Rock ends by dumping you into the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wild Turkey\" href=\"/trail/wild-turkey-trail\">Wild Turkey Trail</a> where you can add some great additional miles in.</p><h2>Getting Back Down</h2> <p>Here comes the payback for that sweat. Like I said, the first time you hit this trail you'll either think it's clunky with no flow, or you'll get owned. But, once you get the groove and know where most of the tricks are, this is a blast heading down. Above the silo, look for tight turns and the occasional rock that double as a kicker. Below the silo, it's super smooth and flowy. Love it, but keep your eyes open for other folks.</p>",

            "description":"<p><b>Bumpy, but pretty. Pretty bumpy.</b></p> <p>I'm going to admit it. This is not one of my favorite trails. I'm sure someone out there thinks this trail is the bomb - probably someome who tests bike suspension for a living. There are some really fun sections of trail on this loop and, if you love riding on pointy baby heads, this is a thrill a minute for you!</p> <h3>Okay, really, this trail has great views and after all the climbing you did getting here, it's pretty flat!</h3> <p>The big upsides to this loop are that the rocky areas aren't big climbs, so you're not fighting rocks and gravity and it's a wonderful viewscape. There are great views from the overlook (see that pic below), lots of wonderful, open trees and, if you're lucky, you might see some resident <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abert's_Squirrel\">Abert's Squirrels</a>.</p> <h3>How to get there and which way to ride</h3> <p>The Ponderosa Loop is at the top of the Wapiti trail which starts at the Heil Valley Ranch Wapiti trailhead. If you ride up that trail until you get to a fork, you are at the Ponderosa Loop.</p> <p>Alternately, you can get to the loop coming up from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/trail/picture-rock-trail\">Picture Rock trail</a> with leads to the <a target=\"_self\" title=\"Wild Turkey\" href=\"/trail/wild-turkey-trail\">Wild Turkey trail</a> and then onto this loop (the Wild Turkey trail actually starts and ends from the Ponderosa Loop and is a great way to add miles to the top of this ride (and it's a lot smoother).</p> <p>If you look at the map, you'll see that the Ponderosa Loop might also be called the Banana Loop due to its shape. If you ride up on the west side of the banana you'll be riding slightly uphill on the more baby head-laden side of the loop. Riding down the East side gets you a bit of fun trail with a great little rock jump. So, that makes this loop work best going clockwise! Of course, neither way is very steep, so expect to pedal a bit going downhill and not too much going uphill.</p>",

            "description":"<p>Gobble up the Wild Turkey for a great add-on to your Heil ride</p> <p>This is another great new trail in Boulder County's quiver of trails. They built it out a few years ago and a good portion of it is silly, fun singletrack. Compared to bone-rattling <a href=\"/trail/ponderosa-loop\" title=\"Ponderosa Loop Trail\" target=\"_blank\">Ponderosa Loop</a> that it connects to, this is like melted butter. Wild Turkey is a great ride for the intermediate rider to work on cornering skills on some really cool swoopy turns - do like Maverick and Goose and \"turn and burn.\" Oh, and the name of this trail ain't no joke. In the spring and summer, you can regularly see wild turkeys.</p> <p>If you are coming to this trail from the Heil Valley Ranch trailhead, you'll be getting onto this from the eastern side of the Pondy Loop. If you're coming from the Picture Rock trailhead in Lyons, you'll be coming in at the lowest point of the Wild Turkey and will be going uphill either way.</p> <h3>How to get your groove here:</h3> <p>This trail is pretty sweet all around, but you can divide it into two sections - the southern section (south of where Picture Rock meets up) is steeper and looser/rocky, minor butt-whooper and the northern is smoother, twistier and flatter. The nice thing is that even though the steep part is rocky, there are some great lines for going uphill where you won't spin the rear wheel and eat the handlebars. The northern section of this has one section with, I swear, may be 300 yards of the silliest, funnest singletrack you'll find anywhere. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the northern section is sweet, too. But that section is like the miracle mile (well, miracle 300 yards) for giggles. If you want the snicker fest, ride this clockwise.</p> <h3>Riding Clockwise (north to south if you don't have one of those old-fangled clocks with hands)</h3> <p>Start at the Overlook and take the trail furthest east (the other two are part of the Ponderosa Loop) and head off on this super smooth trail that follows the rim of the canyon with Hwy 7 below.</p> <h3>The trees of death</h3> <p>If you're riding this trail clockwise from the overlook, the first quarter mile or so is a zippy, easy trail. Just when you think it's safe to hit the overdrive, there's a couple of super sharp turns with big, hard trees looking for love in all the wrong places. The trail's pretty loose here, so it's the perfect conditions for close encounters of the ouch kind.</p> <h3>Rocket ride</h3> <p>After your escape the aforementioned fairly gnarly winding tree section, things get a lot more straightforward. You're going to get some moderately exciting large bouldery-rocky-slabby things to ride over and then before you know it you're going to get to the happy place of joyous turning and burning. Enjoy every one of the 30 or so seconds of this and get ready for a bit of a rough ending. There's a small rock garden at the end of this that won't knock you off the bike, but it will kinda harsh your mellow if you're not ready for it. After that, it's just a couple hundred yards to the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"picture rock\" href=\"/trail/picture-rock-trail\">Picture Rock Trail</a>.</p> <h3>Crank it up the hill</h3> <p>Now that you're at the bottom of the trail named after <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"national bird\" href=\"http://www.greatseal.com/symbols/turkey.html\">Ben Franklin's choice for the national bird of the US</a> it's time to put on the game face and grunt up the south side! Like I said before, it's loose and rocky, but not bad and there are some good lines. That doesn't mean that I haven't gone over the bars here, going uphill, going less than 4 miles an hour, while attractive members of the opposite sex were jogging towards me, but as long as you're not me, you'll probably be just fine.</p> <h3>2nd Verse, do it in reverse (south to north)</h3> <p>Doing this trail from south to north (as if you were coming up from the Wapiti Trail and took a right onto Ponderosa Loop and then a right onto Wild Turkey) you get to ride down the steeper, looser section of trail. It's a great way for intermediate riders to build skill and confidence on looser terrain as the trail is open and pretty straightforward. When you get to the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Picture Rock\" href=\"/trail/picture-rock-trail\">Picture Rock</a> Trail, hook a left turn to stay on your trail (Unless you want to turn right. I'm not the boss of you.). The rest of this trail is a gradual climb with a few easy rocky sections all the way out to the overlook, where you'll meet up with the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pondy Loop\" href=\"/trail/ponderosa-loop\">Ponderosa Loop</a> again.</p> ",

            "description":"<p>If you've made it to the lollypop, you've already had a great ride. Choose wisely: the trail has decidedly different character depending on which way around the loop you decide to take!</p> <p>Take a left on the loop for a steeper and shorter climb. You'll keep about the same pitch you just climbed, and you'll get great views on your left back down towards the prairie dog town and bench at the top of the rock garden. Soon, once the trees thicken, the pitch will steepen and the switchbacks tighten for the hardest climb on the loop. It doesn't last long, and soon you'll top out near some great sitting rocks and your first good views of Longs Peak. Continue on past the homestead and up to the top of the loop. Nearly everyone takes a break here: a great sitting rock, a fantastic view, and it's all (okay, just mostly) downhill from here!</p> <p>Take a right turn at the start of the loop and you get a longer, shallower climb with a steeper descent. Take note at the first hard right hander, there's often a trickle of water through here that can make the rocks a little slick in the spring, and icy in the shoulder months. After that, you'll meander through the forest easily climbing up, with some nice views of Highway 36 over your right shoulder. Make sure to keep one eye on the trail, some of these corners are a bit blind for riders coming downhill. Once you take a left up through the meadow it gets a little steeper with some rocks tossed in at the crest of the hill to make things interesting. One quick downhill to catch your breath, and one short uphill and you've made it to the top and the views. It's all (okay, just mostly) downhill from here!  What about the downhill halves? Just read the uphill explanation backwards!!!</p> <p>Special note: At the top of the loop, there is a trail spur that is hiking only. Don't be tempted to take it, it's not open to bikes. Thanks for being a good citizen, citizen!</p> ",

            "description":"If Sourdough B isn't cruel enough for you.... Formerly known as the Wapiti-Baptiste Trail, this trail had it's beginnings as a cross country ski route.  In 1993, intrepid mountain bikers cleared the deadfall from the trail and got the Boulder Ranger District to administratively add bikes to the 'appropriate uses' in their inventory (you are welcome). From that point on the effort to create a ridable line began.  Work by BMA trail volunteers laid in a 4 to 6 inch line in the rockiest section made this trail even more desirable.This trail is best ridden from the south end to the north, and in conjunction with the Sourdough B and the South St Vrain Trails.  I usually park at the S St Vrain trail trailhead at Beaver Res Road and right off the Peak to Peak Highway.  I ride up the road and jump on Sourdough B and head south.  Ride Sourdough B to the south entrance to Wapiti and ride/push you and your bike up the old logging road.  The top of this hill is right at 10000'. It's time to check your gear and bike; the downhill here is raw and a complete blast.  If there is a line, it's no wider than 2 inches in many, many places.  High consequence and high satisfaction... Once you are back to Sourdough B, ride north and take a right at the unmarked trail. take this trail to the South St Vrain Trail and back to your car. This is a fantastic figure 8 ride that will challenge you.  Snow lingers here; I've seen massive drifts on the trail well into June.",

Big fat glacial boulders, twisty turny trail, rocks everywhere, and really choice mossy forest -- how could it get any better?  If you're jonesing for some technical rock work, Sourdough North has you covered.  Combine this trail with the new no-longer-in-wilderness South St Vrain Trail right next to Brainard Lake.Sourdough North provides a challenging ride both directions, really, although the vast majority of sane folks prefer to go south to north (largely downhill, as shown in the elevation profile below).  Starting from the Red Rocks Trailhead, the rocky challenge begins almost immediately.  After a punishing mile or so, you start to hear the St. Vrain Creek ahead in the forest.  Take a pause on this gorgeous bridge crossing of St. Vrain Creek - a great reminder of why the Colorado high country is so dang badass!",

            "description":"<p>This ride is one of the funnest stretches of creekside singletrack in Boulder County...followed by a heinous climb up to Miller Rock. From the trailhead you ride downhill following narrow, twisty singletrack - super flowy with the occasional tough technical move. And don't fall on those technical spots either as the steep drop to South St. Vrain Creek has claimed more than a few collarbones over the years.</p> <p>At the bottom of the singletrack descent, take stock of your will power. The climb up to Miller Rock is a doozie, and don't forget you'll be climbing back out to the trailhead. Miller Rock is well worth it, though, with some of the best views of the Continental Divide around. Local lore has it that a man named Miller took refuge on the rock after a lynch mob came after him for stealing a horse (think about how bikers feel about bike thieves). Miller, being such a smart thief, snuck on top of the rock where he waited the lynch mob out...until he starved to death the tale goes.</p> <p>There are two ways to get up to Miller Rock, and they are both heinous. We recommend the counterclockwise loop as the hair-raising descent is super fun in that direction. Bring a map as the roads and trails get confusing around here. First you'll ride, push, and carry your bike uphill on a nasty jeep road that has degraded into fields of babyheads in places. Once you flatten out bear left at the second intersection and continue up the jeep road to the base of Miller Rock.</p> <p>For a nice view and a sweet snack spot, get off your bike, walk around to the backside of the rock, and scramble up. Once you've had your fill of the expansive views, get back on your bike and head back the way you came (continuing uphill takes you to private property). As you retrace your steps, look out for singletrack heading off to the right of the jeep road you just climbed. The intersection is not marked. This singletrack descent goes from fast and flowy to downright death-defying. Have fun, but remember how far from civilization you are at this point. The pucker factor weeds a lot of people off this trail after the first attempt. Once you are safely at the bottom again, it's time to ride back up the creekside singletrack to the trailhead.</p> ",
